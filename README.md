<a id="installation"></a>
## Installation
Would need MongoDB, as well as everything listed in the package.json. 
Please run npm i to install everything needed. 

<a id="usage"></a>
## Usage
The main usage of this code is a solid reference in converting a RESTful API to a GraphQL API. There we a lot of steps and troubleshooting in resolving this. I think seeing the commits and comments will help any future similar experience.
